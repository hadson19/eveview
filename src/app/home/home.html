        <p>The Idea of this app is to let users evaluate item price data in Eve.
            First pick a couple of Regions to monitor.  (Jita is in "The Forge")

            Second pick some items.  Not more than 5, and minerals usually have price information.
        </p>

        Added BOM selection for items on the items selection screen.
        Listed are major trade hubs in the order of importance. Jita being at the top and default selected.
        If you pick a different tradehub, the results will be seen based on the selection. This gives you a best choice for going after materials for building items.
